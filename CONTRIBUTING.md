## 💻 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- .NET 10 SDK

### Linux Setup

1. **Install system dependencies**:
   - `polkit` (required for daemon authorization)
   - `libevdev` development headers (if building from source)

2. **Install the daemon**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/daemon/install.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Build and install the daemon to `/opt/crossmacro/daemon`
   - Create the `crossmacro` system user and group
   - Set up the systemd service
   - Add your user to the `crossmacro` group

3. **Reboot your system** for group changes to take effect.

4. **Build and run the UI**:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run --project src/CrossMacro.UI/
   ```

### Windows Setup

1. **Build and run**:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run --project src/CrossMacro.UI/
   ```
   
   No additional setup required - Windows uses API hooks directly.

### macOS Setup

1. **Build and run**:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run --project src/CrossMacro.UI/
   ```

   **Permissions**: You will be prompted to grant Accessibility permissions on the first run. This is required for CGEvent Taps to function.
